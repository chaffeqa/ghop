      </a>, we are able to understand that it is our privelage to minister to
      God through our finances. Purhaps we do not have musical talent, but do
      possess marketplace abilities. Then it is our blessing to be able to
      support those in the Kingdom who God has given the gift of music and
      singing.

      Imagine an artist (musician, singer, or visual artist) who is
      un-encumbered by the dependance on their creative ability to produce a
      livelyhood for them or their loved ones. Imagine the beauty that would
      release them to create! That is what is in God's heart! That is the heart
      David saw and pursued! That is the heart we want to have as the Bride!
