      What does that mean for us as the Bride? It means that we need to be
      serious about supporting the singers and musicians that minister to our
      Beloved. To David, it was perfectly logical to devote a{' '}
      <strong>percentage</strong> of the governments income to pay for singers
      and musicians to perform, not part time, not on the side, but{' '}
      <strong>full time</strong> occupation of composing, playing, and singing
      songs to and about our Beloved Betrothed: Jesus Christ.
