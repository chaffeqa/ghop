      The Granby House of Prayer (<a href="https://ghop.us.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">

      </a>){` `}
      is a all-are-welcome House of Prayer that meets to worship our Lord and
      Savior: Jesus Christ.{` `}
      and intercede for His bride: The Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ghop was born out of the vision of night and day prayer with worship in
      order to enable the{` `}
      Body of Christ (the Bride) to fall more in love with her betrothed.

    <p>
      We currently meet every Monday enjoy food and fellowship at 6:30pm. At
      7:30 we transition into worship and prayer.  Anyone, at any point of their walk with God, or even those intrigued at
        who He is, are welcome to come!
